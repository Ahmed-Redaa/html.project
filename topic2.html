    Q2:-Can the COVID-19 virus be spread by shoes?
    The possibility of transmission of COVID-19 infection by shoes to individuals is very low. As a precaution, especially in homes where there are babies and young children who love or play on the floor, consider removing shoes and leaving them at the entrance to the house. This will help prevent any dirt or debris that may have stuck to the soles and shoes from being brought into the house.
    Q3:- Are antibiotics effective in preventing and treating the emerging coronavirus?
    no but a lot of them can try"
