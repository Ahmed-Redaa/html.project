    "And World Health Organization said that:-
     Fact1: You can recover from illness caused by the coronavirus (COVID-19). Being infected with the new corona virus does not mean that you will be infected with the virus forever. Most people who get COVID-19 recover completely and get rid of the virus from their bodies. If you do get sick, be sure to treat your symptoms. If you have a cough, fever and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention early, but phone the health care facility first. Most patients recover with supportive care.
     fact2:-5G wireless networks do not spread COVID-19 infection Viruses cannot travel over radio waves or mobile phone networks. COVID-19 is spreading in many countries that do not even have 5G networks. COVID-19 is spread by respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks. The infection is transmitted to people if they touch a contaminated surface and then touch their eyes, mouth or nose"
